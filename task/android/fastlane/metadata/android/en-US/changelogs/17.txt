- Breaking changes:
  + taskd.certificate filename saved before version update is lost, reselect file to replace
  + Fewer or later checks, e.g.:
    * App doesn't catch null credentials
    * App catches null server instead of no TASKRC
    * App allows connection attempts with any PEM files
- Changes to profiles UI
  + List of profiles is folded, so that queries may be easier to access
  + Profile management is now limited to selected profile
