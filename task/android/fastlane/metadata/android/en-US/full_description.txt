"task add", or simply, "task", is an unofficial mobile client to Taskserver.

In other words, "task add" is a todo app, for Android and iOS.

The interface is inspired by Taskwarrior and TaskwarriorC2.

This app is an amateur/hobby project, useful to at least me. I expect the target audience may be limited to somewhere between 10 and 1000 people on the planet.

Features:

- Add, edit, list, sort, filter your tasks.
- Sync tasks with a Taskserver.
- Export tasks in a format similar to cli task's export command.

Quirks:

- To remove a due date, long-press the button.

If you want to use a Taskserver to sync your tasks, I recommend you use a self-hosted instance so that you have full access to server logs and data.
